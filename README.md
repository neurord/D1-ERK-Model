# D1-ERK-Model
Erk signalling Pathways in the D1 neurons of striatum have been modelled.This is done systematically starting from just the PKC loop and then addition of Calcium Pathways,cAMP, Gq coupled Pathways and finally the inclusion of enhanced Gq pathways to mimic the action of estradiol in the D1 neurons of the striatum.  
Refer diagram below for signalling pathways modelled.
